# Kanban Task Management

A kanban board developed with sveltekit. Not all features are yet supported and hence a live preview is not available.

## Local preview

1. Install dependencies:
```
pnpm install
```

2. Run dev server
```
pnpm dev
```

## Disclaimer

This challenge is for pro members only. As I'm not a pro member, I do not have to requirements or specifications for this challenge. However, I have looked at the pictures provided for the overview and have developed the app based on that.
